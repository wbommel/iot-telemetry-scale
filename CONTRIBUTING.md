## 🧱 Project Structure

Each subproject is independent but follows a few shared conventions:

## 📐 Code Style & Practices

- For **Python**: follow PEP8
- For **Node.js**: use `eslint` + `prettier`
- For **Arduino**: keep modular, lightweight, and readable
- Use descriptive commit messages: `fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`, etc.
- Comment complex logic!
