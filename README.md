# IoT Telemetry Scale üì°‚öñÔ∏è

A modular open-source system for wireless weight sensing, live telemetry, and remote monitoring ‚Äî designed for small animals, feeding stations, or general-purpose IoT measurement.

**This is the meta repository** linking all parts of the project ecosystem.

## üîß What It Does

- üìè Measures weight via load cell & HX711
- üì∂ Publishes readings via MQTT
- üé• Streams live video with snapshots
- üß† Stores and organizes measurements per individual
- üìä Displays charts, dashboards, and historical data
- üè† Integrates with Home Assistant & ioBroker
- üí° Designed to be flexible, low-stress, and extensible
